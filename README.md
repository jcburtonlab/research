# Burton Lab Research
Welcome to the main research repo for the Burton Lab at Emory University. This is a companion to the [Burton Lab Research website](https://www.jcburtonlab.com/), which is the primary public reference for our work.

## Research Focus
> I have broad research interests which span many different disciplines and fields. Although this can often pose a challenge, I find that diverse interests help maintain a high level of academic creativity in my research, and exposes my students to new ideas and scientific methods.
In general, I am interested in problems at the interface of nonequilibrium physics, soft matter physics, and Earth sciences. What does this mean exactly? At its core, physics attempts to uncover the commonalities between seemingly unrelated phenomena; to describe the world with elegant theories and unifying principles. Nonequilibrium systems present a grand challenge in that regard. A nonequilibrium system defies expectation. Even if one knows the properties of every component, the system as a whole can display emergent phenomena which is unpredictable. The most ubiquitous, but perhaps not the simplest, example of a nonequilibrium system is life. Even if we knew the exact properties of every protein and chromosome in the body, it is nearly impossible to predict the someone’s personality. Another well-known examples include Earth’s climate system. However, my interests lie in much simpler examples that we can study in the lab, where we can characterize exactly how a system avoids an equilibrium state.
Soft matter is a term that describes the physics of things that have some degree of softness. Their soft properties can be obvious, like gels, tissues, foams, and complex fluids like paint, or they can be subtler, such as the ability of a granular material (sand) to transition from a flowing state to a very rigid one. Some common features of “soft materials” include the importance of temperature fluctuations, like the random Brownian motion of small particles in a fluid, and also a disordered structure, like the unorganized positions of atoms in window glass. These features have traditionally been avoided in condensed matter and material physics for many years due to their complexity and nonequilibrium nature. However, they have received considerable attention in the last few decades, beginning with some of the pioneering theories of Nobel Laureate Pierre de Gennes (1991). Now soft matter is a rapidly growing field which encompasses physicists, biologists, and engineers studying complex fluids, polymers, and biological tissues and cells, among many other examples.
How do these topics relate to Earth science? The vast majority of our planet is covered with dirt, sand, or water. The physics of these individual materials generates a vast amount of scientific literature in their own right, and the interfaces between these materials are even more complex. Everyone knows that the partially-wet sand at the edge of the lapping beach waves is best for sandcastles. Why? Like a soft foam, made of gas and liquid yet displays solid-like properties, wet sand is an example of a complex material, although in this case plays an important role in shaping Earth’s hydrology and landscape. I see nonequilibrium processes and soft materials in many of Earth’s most important systems. Applied physics has traditionally played a large role in industrial and technological settings, seeding the discovery of new material properties on the smallest atomic scales. One of my interests and goals is to extend these ideas to large-scale planetary processes in order to better explain their inherent complexity.
